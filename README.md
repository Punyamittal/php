## Introduction

PHP is a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development. It powers millions of websites and is a great tool for building dynamic and interactive web applications. This repository provides hands-on examples, exercises, and projects to make your learning journey comprehensive and enjoyable.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Install PHP (version 7.4 or later) on your system. You can download it from [php.net](https://www.php.net/downloads).
- Install a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or use XAMPP/WAMP for an all-in-one solution).
- Use a text editor or IDE such as VS Code, PHPStorm, or Sublime Text.

### Running PHP Code
1. To run standalone scripts, use the terminal:
   ```bash
   php filename.php
   ```
2. To test web applications, place files in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Start the server and navigate to `http://localhost/filename.php` in your browser.
